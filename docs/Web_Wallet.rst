Token holders in the TRON community fall into the following categories:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Token holder: Individual holding any amount of TRX.

2. Super Representative candidate: 100 individuals elected through voting by the entire token holder community. Elections are held once every 24 hours.

3. Super Representative: 27 individuals elected through voting by all token holders every 24 hours. Super Representatives play a key role in governing the TRON community by ensuring basic functions, e.g. block generation and bookkeeping, and obtain corresponding earnings.    Super Representatives can produce blocks and verify transactions. Meanwhile, Super Representatives can make an actual profit from creating blocks.
