DPoS VS PoS VS PoW
------------------

PoW (proof of work) has downsides like high electric power consumption. Its inefficient consensus mechanism results in low TPS. Therefore, it won’t fit the outlook of TRON. 

PoS (proof of stake) outstands to be the undeniable guideline for TRON in order to be a primary blockchain platform for everyday use. We have fully researched the most impressive ideas in the field of blockchain and we know for certain that the improved DPoS (distributed proof of stake) can be TRON’s consensus mechanism to meet our future demands.
